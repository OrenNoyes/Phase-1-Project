Phase-1 Project

PITCH:
The basic story of your application

The core features of your MVP

The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it

Challenges you expect to face

How you are meeting the requirements of the project


EXECUTION:
Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).

Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need

Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.

Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.

Continue building features one by one.

BUILDING A LIBRARY/CATALOG 
As a user I want to be able to type in an artists name... 
1. And pull up their full discography
2. Include the album art with the discography
    - I want to be able to click on an album and add it to my Vinyl Library, 
    - OR add it to a "wishlist"
    - AND give the albums a rating
3. See the artist's concert history
    - Add specific events to my Attended Concerts list
    - Also see upcoming concerts for that artist 
        - Add them to my "want to go" list

1. Find an event with a lesser than or equal price and view:
